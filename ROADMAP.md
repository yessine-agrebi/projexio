# Projexio MVP Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the key features and milestones for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Projexio, the open-source digital portfolio builder.

## Phase 1: Setting Up the Foundation

- **Step 1: Project Setup and Boilerplate Code**
  - Set up the basic folder structure and configuration for the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js with Express).
  - Create the initial file structure, including essential files like `package.json`, `.gitignore`, and `README.md`.
  - Implement the basic server and frontend components to ensure everything is connected correctly.

- **Step 2: User Authentication**
  - Implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to handle user registration and login.
  - Provide basic user profile functionality, including updating profile information.

- **Step 3: Database Integration**
  - Connect the backend to MongoDB to store user data, portfolio information, and project details.
  - Set up basic API routes to handle CRUD operations for user profiles and projects.

## Phase 2: Building Portfolio Creation and Showcase

- **Step 4: Portfolio Creation**
  - Allow users to create and customize their portfolios with a title, description, and cover image.
  - Implement the option for users to set their portfolios as public or private.

- **Step 5: Project Showcase**
  - Add functionality to enable users to create and showcase their projects within their portfolios.
  - Include fields for project title, description, images, skills used, and project URLs.

## Phase 3: User Interface and User Experience Enhancements

- **Step 6: Responsive Design**
  - Ensure that the application is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Step 7: User-Friendly Interface**
  - Improve the user interface to be intuitive and easy to navigate for creating portfolios and adding projects.
  - Implement interactive elements and clear instructions to guide users throughout the process.

## Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Step 8: Testing**
  - Write unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality of the application.
  - Perform manual testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

- **Step 9: Code Review and Refinement**
  - Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
  - Refactor and optimize code for maintainability and performance.

## Phase 5: Deployment and Launch

- **Step 10: Production Deployment**
  - Prepare the application for production deployment.
  - Deploy the MVP to a hosting platform such as Heroku.

- **Step 11: Public Release**
  - Announce the public release of the Projexio MVP.
  - Share the project with the community and seek user feedback.

## Future Roadmap

After the successful launch of the MVP, we will gather user feedback and iterate on the platform to add more advanced features and functionalities. Some potential future roadmap items could include:

- Advanced portfolio customization options (themes, color schemes, layout choices).
- Enhanced project categorization and organization.
- Social media sharing and integration features.
- Collaboration capabilities for team projects.
- Integration with popular version control platforms (GitHub, GitLab) to showcase code repositories.
